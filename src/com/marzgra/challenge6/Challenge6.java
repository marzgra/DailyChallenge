    An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list.
    Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both,
    which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which
    adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.

    If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python),
    you can assume you have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions
    that converts between nodes and memory addresses.
    -------------------------------------------------
    This challenge is too complicated for me to be solved in Java.
    I might take this challenge in the future, as time allows.
